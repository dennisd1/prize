    text: "As a theme developer I get a lot of feedback from Jekyll users. The ones I hear from the most are generally non-devs who gravitate to Jekyll because of the free hosting GitHub Pages provides. From their comments there definitely is a void to fill in providing a service that makes working with Jekyll easier. Whether that's something like prose.io, a GUI wrapper for those who fear the CLI, or just making it easier to get it installed and running on their system. As far as features for Jekyll it seems to be moving in the right direction with 3.0. I have a fairly large Jekyll site and it takes forever to build, so anything to improve performance there has my vote. With the incremental rebuild stuff the Jekyll core team is working on hopefully that will be a non-issue."

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll.

In this, my final post of the three part series, I look at the direction these influencers hope Jekyll and it's community will continue to grow.

<!-- excerpt stop -->

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll. The first post in this series covered [5 reasons to love Jekyll](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/04/5-reasons-you-should-use-jekyll.html) and the second post looked at [5 traps for Jekyll beginners](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/13/5-common-jekyll-traps.html).

In the third and final post this blog series I want to look at how _current_ influencers hope the product and community will continue to develop.

Jekyll is the [most popular static site generator on the web](https://www.staticgen.com/). Consider that Octopress is basically a large set of Jekyll plugins and that lead extends even further. Jekyll is a tool and a community in a growth spurt.

If you want to contribute to Jekyll in some way going forward, consider these areas of code and content in demand by the community!

A growing base of knowledgeable users can only be good for Jekyll.

The final big survey question I put to my influencers was **&quot;What is Jekyll and/or it&#39;s community currently missing?&quot;**

#### The TL;DR:

Top 6 Jekyll contribution gaps you can fill as identified by the Jekyll community:

1.  Evangelists
2.  Tutorials
3.  Advanced Documentation
4.  Themes
5.  Share GUIs
6.  Compile Speed

#### Breaking it down.

**1.  Evangelists**

{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.mike%}

Normally I leave the quotes to the bottom of these posts but I want to highlight this one. I think it is my favourite quote from this whole research process.

Jekyll is awesome. Far more awesome than the status quo, and people need to know about it.

Jekyll has a young, small community compared to incumbent popular website solutions. Until recently the community has not been hugely vocal. It has been limited to the GitHub issues board, a list of sites running Jekyll, and a thin spread of blog posts about it&#39;s use.

I&#39;m excited about the birth of the offical discussion forum [talk.jekyllrb.com](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) earlier this month. It&#39;s just starting out but it feels like the beginning of a more open, vocal, connected Jekyll.

So number one way you can help Jekyll - tell others about it.

**2 &amp; 3. Tutorials &amp; Advanced Documentation**

I had to think about whether #2 Tutorials and #3 Advanced Documentation were the same thing. I decided they weren&#39;t. I&#39;ll address them together though. Here&#39;s how I distinguish:

*   Tutorials - Guides for replicating existing functionality
*   Advanced Documentation - Guides for informing the extension of functionality.

We looked at initial installation frustrations last week. Some influencers have looked for advice on implementing advanced features like integrated site search. There is a demand at all levels for tutorials.

As contributor [Troy Swanson](https://twitter.com/gerphimum/) commented during the [Feb '15 Jekyll Townhall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRCXRkUVAag), while lots of features are well covered by documentation and existing tutorials, there is still a lack of definitive best practice published.

Yet Jekyll will never be all things to all people. And, like developers are prone to do, there is the desire out there to build custom solutions and plugins. Advanced documentation about how Jekyll behaves and how others can integrate with it is also in demand. If you understand, do share.

**4.  Themes**

A blank canvas is liberating to some and utterly terrifying to others.

There are high quality themes currently available but the range is limited.

If you have the design skills, there is a community eager to see, share and use your work.

**5.  Share GUIs**

Jekyll was originally built as a blogging tool for developers by developers. Yet it seems to have grown past that now. Jekyll has played a part in further enabling static sites to be a viable option for delivering content on today&#39;s web.

But developers aren&#39;t the only creators of content.

HTML, Markdown and Git tend to bring up the defences in non-developers. Thus Jekyll powered sites have been hard to use with non-technical contributors. Developers who work with these people can see the benefits of static and the potential for Jekyll, but they feel the friction.

If you work with non-technical clients or a team, encourage them to try an interface like [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) or [CloudCannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjd0V_pET5E). Coach them and support them. To help spread Jekyll adoption, project decision makers other than developers have to know about it.

**6.  Compile Speed**

Again, we touched on this [last week](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/13/5-common-jekyll-traps.html). The Jekyll Core Team have been targeting this as priority number one for [Jekyll 3.00](http://jekyllrb.com/news/2015/01/24/jekyll-3-0-0-beta1-released/). Download the beta, try the iterative regeneration out and feedback into the dev process.

#### In their own words:

**&quot;What is Jekyll and/or it&#39;s community currently missing?&quot;**

{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.michael%}
{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.michelle%}

{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.richard%}
{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.alan%}
{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.marco%}
{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.matt%}

#### Bottom line.

If you like Jekyll: Tell someone, share what you know, test and/or contribute!
