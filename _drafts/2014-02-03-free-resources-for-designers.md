Today we’re releasing three completely free, high quality, responsive HTML5 templates you can use for your next website. These templates have an MIT license so you can basically use them for whatever you want and don’t need to give us any credit.

Giving these templates away is part of our vision to improve the life of designers. We’re working on some big ideas for CloudCannon and have more free resources in the pipeline to give you guys so keep an ear out. Let us know what you think of the templates and share them with your friends.

You can view the templates by creating a new website on CloudCannon or download them as a standalone from our [Freebies](/freebies) page.

We've also added websockets to CloudCannon so now when you add/delete a file in your Dropbox it will update on the CloudCannon file browser the moment we see the change.
